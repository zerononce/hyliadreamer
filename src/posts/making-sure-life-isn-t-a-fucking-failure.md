\### Introduction / Motivation

The motivation for the creation of this piece came about in the middle of a larger analysis on the $BAT token. Originally, the intent was to put out a price analysis on the token as well as an outlook at its fundamentals.

However, while reviewing the fundamentals, it became apparent that $BAT is a prime candidate to get smacked by the SEC.

In order to make this argument, though, information about the crowdsale was and is necessary.

Thus, we began our descent down into the rabbit hole known as Ethereum contract/token analysis. (cue scary music)

\### Major Discrepancy — $BAT Token Sale Information

In conducting research on $BAT, specifically, we noticed that there was a surprising lack of information regarding the token sale (and related sources of information for the token itself)**_._**

\#### Examples of Lacking Information

\**Inadequate Resource #1**: Cryptorank.io

Let’s take a look at the insufficient information that the website, ‘Cryptorank.io’, gives on $BAT.

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*lFS1_NyMBpTMTEPN.png)

As we can see above, Cryptorank only put the ICO price of $ETH on their website, which happens to be incorrect.

And because Cryptorank’s listed price (USD) for $BAT is incorrect, their ROI totals are as well.

\**In addition, their $BAT token sale breakdown does not provide any information on**:

1\.  How many units (total) were sold during the $BAT token sale

2\.  The addresses that were involved in the token sale (or even the contract address for $BAT itself!)

3\.  The length of the ICO

4\.  The total amount raised in the crowdsale

5\.  The targeted total

6\.  The amount (USD or $ETH) at the time of contribution

As well as countless other metrics that would be **_very useful_** in assessing $BAT’s performance, overall, for those that are serious about gaining a true, analytical understanding of $BAT’s market interactions.

\**Inadequate Resource #2:** Messari.io

Unfortunately, another major, vaulted source of information in the blockchain sphere also proved itself to be woefully lacking in terms of the information given on the $BAT token.

\**As we can see below, the dates of the crowdsale itself were off** (**_substantially_**):

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*ey8IwKP3sj0t-Uz_.png)

The token sale was not conducted on May 22nd, 2019, but rather on May 31st, 2017.

This is corroborated by countless websites, including the whitepaper that Messari themselves had cited on the very same page as well as $BAT’s token sale contracts (which are still publicly available in multiple sources and in this report as well).

\**More Incorrect Information By Messari**

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0")*Fs27GAUwH43MAxCi.png)

On the very same page, Messari incorrectly claims that 130 investors took part in the $BAT token sale.

The total number of investors in the token sale was actually 186 (technically, 185, \[since there was one address that received two contributions from the token sale address\]([https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x001934d46ef025ec18f292f4c5f42ec85f2deb26](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x001934d46ef025ec18f292f4c5f42ec85f2deb26 "https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x001934d46ef025ec18f292f4c5f42ec85f2deb26"))).

\**With regards to the address that participated twice in the token sale their transactions are**:

1\.  \[[https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476 "https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476")\]([https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476 "https://etherscan.io/tx/0x86a55409442b98af10f1045815f1e72b94fe9841600cb9b43abc31c224db9476"))

\#### A Full Analysis of $BAT’s Token Sale is Imperative

Since the information regarding $BAT’s token sale is not widely available in any comprehensive manner **_anywhere on the internet or elsewhere_**, this report is being conducted as a means of doing so, preemptively & properly.

The goal of this report is to provide all of the related information for the token sale (including token metrics that reflect the current status of $BAT).

\### $BAT’s ERC20 Contract

Fortunately for us, $BAT has \[copies of their contracts on GitHub\]([https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/tree/15bebdc0642dac614d56709477c7c31d5c993ae1/contracts](https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/tree/15bebdc0642dac614d56709477c7c31d5c993ae1/contracts "https://github.com/brave-intl/basic-attention-token-crowdsale/tree/15bebdc0642dac614d56709477c7c31d5c993ae1/contracts")) (very widely avaiable).

\**See below**:

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*0eEMiOf-Sbm6F6nL.png)

\**Above, we have**:

1\.  BATsafe.sol

2\.  BAToken.abi / BAToken.sol

3\.  Safemath.sol

4\.  StandardToken.sol

Definitive crowdsale values, times, additional related contract addresses, etc., can be found directly in these contracts.

Take a look at some of the snapshots below from related smart contracts:

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*qWG1ZqA-PswXXpXm.png)

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*yXU_y89fXOJaiTP0.png)

Of particular importance here, is the amount of $BAT granted to investors per Ethereum.

\### Interactive Display of All $BAT’s Contracts

We took the liberty of aggregating all of $BAT’s contract information and hosting it on ‘\[Glitch\]([http://glitch.com/](http://glitch.com/ "http://glitch.com/"))’.

\**See below**:

<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="[https://glitch.com/edit/#](https://glitch.com/edit/# "https://glitch.com/edit/#")!/bat-project?path=README.md:1:0" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>(Insert the code from the Glitch repository)

\#### Auditing the $BAT Contracts

There are a number of different, freely available sources for those that wish to audit Solidity (Ethereum) based smart contracts.

\**For $BAT specifically, we have the results of the ‘**\[**SmartCheck’ audit**\]([https://tool.smartdec.net/](https://tool.smartdec.net/ "https://tool.smartdec.net/"))**, posted below**:

<iframe height="1050px" width="100%" src="[https://tool.smartdec.net/scan/adae91e57db9411f8cbcccc93de42d11](https://tool.smartdec.net/scan/adae91e57db9411f8cbcccc93de42d11 "https://tool.smartdec.net/scan/adae91e57db9411f8cbcccc93de42d11")" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>(insert the results of the SmartCheck Audit)

\#### Quick Reminder: Token Sales are Pegged to a Fixed Amount of Ethereum

Often, when we speak about ‘token sales’, ‘ICOs’, etc., on Ethereum’s blockchain, we mention the amount raised in terms of fiat currency (i.e., ‘This project raised $50 million in an ICO!’).

However, when looking at crowdsale contracts on a blockchain level, you’ll notice that there is no mention of ‘fiat currency’, and there are no pieces of code embedded in the Solidity / EVM documentation that reference such a concept either.

\**Why?**

The reason why this is, is because blockchains are not programmed to recognize ‘real world events’.

In other words, the concept of fiat currency mean nothing.

Thus, if Ethereum is trading for $100, hypothetically, and you are valuing your coin at 1 Ethereum per coin — you will not be able to readjust the contribution amount reflexively if Ethereum happens to increase or decrease dramatically during the crowdsale period.

Therefore, we can quickly find out a lot of information about a crowdsale by simply looking at the contract and parsing out the ‘exchange rate’ (it will probably say the words, ‘exchange rate’, in most contracts).

\### Taking a Look at $BAT’s Contract on Etherscan

Words cannot express how awesome Etherscan is as a resource for those that are looking to gleam information about Ethereum, on-chain activity, tokens, contracts, events, etc.

It is completely free, the site is well-maintained, there’s room for community feedback, the developers of the website are pretty responsive if you reach out to them with an issue and it loads up very quickly.

All major keys.*

\**Disclaimer***: _We are_ **_not sponsored_** _or involved with Etherscan in anyway. Although, we do rely on them heavily as a resource for Ethereum-related activities._

\### Let’s Check Out What it Says on Etherscan for $BAT

For some reason, the information that is on Etherscan regarding $BAT is currently incorrect.

\**Let’s start by visiting this link here**: \[[https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo "https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo")\]([https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo "https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#tokenInfo"))

Below, we can see that the ‘initial offer price’ for $BAT is listed with the following on Etherscan:

\**$0.04 USD/token**

\**0.00018025 $ETH/token**

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*n7GPCJZ-FMSM2gMg.png)

However, if we look at the actual contract (as well as the contract details), we can see that this is **_not the case._**

Below is the ‘tokenExchangeRate’, which is listed under the ‘contract details’ panel on Etherscan:

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*dYZl2aUkzQ2qPi8G.png)

If we look up the \[contract source code on Etherscan\]([https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code "https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef#code")), then do a keyword search for ‘6400’, we’ll find that it is stipulated in there as well.

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*ZbjNKdz4aSMFXcBi.png)

\**Quick Math**:

1\.  The contract stipulates that 1 ETH = 6400 $BAT

2\.  Therefore, finding the price, per $BAT, would involve us taking the reciprocal of #1 (1/6400)

3\.  This gives us 0.00015625 $ETH per $BAT, which is different than the total given on Etherscan.

4\.  The contract also gives us a specific start time, which was at \[block height 3798640\]([https://etherscan.io/block/3798640](https://etherscan.io/block/3798640 "https://etherscan.io/block/3798640")), which occurred on May 31st, 2017 at 2:24 p.m. UTC

5\.  At the start of the fundraise period, the price of $ETH (per $ETH) was approximately $228 (this is almost exactly what the general price of Ethereum was around the cryptosphere at the exact time that the crowdsale began).

6\.  Doing the math, if the going price was 1 $ETH for 6400 $BAT and 1 $ETH is valued at $228, then flipping the reciprocal and replacing (1 ETH) with the dollar value gives us the USD value of each $BAT token at the time of the fundraise’s start. Thus, the final equation here would be 228/6400, resulting in a price of roughly $0.035 (exactly $0.035625).

\**This next part is merely FYI, but here are some additional fun facts about $BAT’s token sale**:

\-   $BAT received 79,350 Ethereum in the same block that the crowdsale began

\-   At the price of $228 / Ethereum, that amounts to $18 million worth of Ethereum (at the time of transfer), within the **_first couple of minutes_**

\#### Extracting Additional Variables From the $BAT Crowdsale Contract

Other variables in the contract give us the other necessary information as well.

\**For instance, we know that**:

1\.  uint256 public constant batFund = 500 * (10**6) * 10**decimals ; //**_This means that there are 500m BAT reserved for Brave Intl use_**

2\.  uint256 public constant tokenCreationCap = 1500 * (10**6) * 10**decimals ; // **_1.5 billion BAT created at max._**

3\.  uint256 public constant tokenCreationMin = 675 * (10**6) * 10**decimals ; // **_A minimum of 675 million tokens created_** (contingent on the results of the crowdsale)

\**There are other defined elements in the crowdsale as well, such as** :

\-   \[**_ethFundDeposit**\]([https://etherscan.io/address/0xac2fa512db158f44f5ee2fa5766ea7c282763cdb](https://etherscan.io/address/0xac2fa512db158f44f5ee2fa5766ea7c282763cdb "https://etherscan.io/address/0xac2fa512db158f44f5ee2fa5766ea7c282763cdb"))

\-   \[**_batFundDeposit**\]([https://etherscan.io/address/0x88e2efac3d2ef957fcd82ec201a506871ad06204](https://etherscan.io/address/0x88e2efac3d2ef957fcd82ec201a506871ad06204 "https://etherscan.io/address/0x88e2efac3d2ef957fcd82ec201a506871ad06204"))

\-   \[**_fundingStartBlock**\]([https://etherscan.io/block/3798640](https://etherscan.io/block/3798640 "https://etherscan.io/block/3798640"))

\-   \[**_fundingEndBlock**\]([https://etherscan.io/block/3963480](https://etherscan.io/block/3963480 "https://etherscan.io/block/3963480"))

You will not see these addresses and block heights listed directly in the contract, they are instead defined in the contrcact ABI **_(which needs to be decoded)_**.

\[**Etherscan fortunately has four of the critical addresses outlined for us here**\]([https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/basic-attention-token](https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/basic-attention-token "https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/basic-attention-token")):

!\[\]([https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0 "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/0")*hd5vH87TpEL8e3CR.png)

\#### Gaining a Better Understanding of the Hierarchy of Contracts

\**Below, is an embedded chart from Etherscan, which shows the hierarchy of contract calls & functions**:
